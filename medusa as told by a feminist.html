<p>The tale of Medusa is something I take very personally. To put 
it very briefly, not all myths were told the exact
same way in Ancient Greece. The whole mainland/island complex was
built up of many different city-states, which had very different
cultures and social norms. As such, the city-state that was and
still is held as the height of Greek learning and knowledge was 
the city of Athens, located on the southern coast. That was 
where many of the authors, poets, and philosophers of Ancient 
Greece made their
homes, but it is also a place where a lot of the myths that we
know were subject to their inherent bias. You see, in many
city-states, women were barely considered to be human.
They were inferior to "men" in every way. They could not hold the
same relationships as men, they did not feel the same things men
felt, etc. etc. It was horrible. This is in stark contrast to 
the city-state of Sparta, which viewed a woman as a man's equal in
every way. My favorite part about Sparta is that they buried the
women who died in childbirth in the exact same manner as they'd 
bury a fallen warrior, because to the Spartans it was exactly the
same. Even the goddess of love, Aphrodite, was depicted in a very,
very different manner in Sparta than she was in Athens. In Athens,
Aphrodite was the airhead goddess of love. Her only traits were 
sleeping with people, making other people fall in love, and 
being a mega drama queen. In Sparta, Aphrodite was the goddess of
passion. She was the intensity of love, yes, but she was also the
intensity of every other emotion. They depicted her in full armor,
ready to fight, which is a far cry from how anyone else saw her.
The same concept applies to the tale of Medusa.<p/>

<p>Medusa was a priestess of Athena. As was the custom of
priestesses, she dedicated herself fully to the divine,
which included celibacy, especially since Athena was a virginal
goddess.
One night, as Medusa stood vigil in the seaside temple, the ocean
god Poseidon rose up out of the sea and raped Medusa. It's pretty
messed up. It is obscene and sacreligious to consummate in the
temple of another god, whether it was consensual or not.
Remember, women weren't the same as men in many places, so
to a lot of people who heard and retold the story,
it was 100% Medusa's fault that
she got raped. In an Athenian telling of this myth, they would
say something along the lines of how angry Athena was at Medusa.
How dare she get raped in her temple?! After all the devoting
Medusa had done, this was the last and only straw. Athena would
curse Medusa, turning her gaze into one that turns men to stone,
and her hair into a bed of snakes, so that she could never lie
with another man ever again. How punishing. Now consider the story from the
angle of a <i>goddess</i> of wisdom, as Athena is. One of her most devote
priestesses has just been raped in her temple. The culprit is
another god, and a god cannot curse another god, especially when
both gods are members of the Council of Olympus. Medusa is
probably expecting to be punished. So,
as the goddess of knowledge and wisdom, Athena doesn't curse Medusa, but
gifts her. Gifts her with the power to turn any man into stone, so
that no one can hurt her again. Gifts her with a bed of snakes as
hair, so that any man who does manage to get close would be 
bitten and die of a snake-mauling long before he sets his hands
on her. Athena makes it so that no one can hurt Medusa again.
<p> Medusa is exiled from her home, sent to the far reaches of
the known Mediterranean world, where she lives in relative peace.
I believe that Athena
also gifted the whole snake shebang to Medusa's sisters, so that she at the
very least wouldn't be alone as she was cast out of her homeland.
Cut to the story of Perseus, about halfway through,
when he's tasked with slaying Medusa so that some random king won't
marry his mom against her will. Perseus shows up, slays
Medusa's sisters, and is coming for her next. An Athenian telling
would frame Medusa as a monster.
She would fight dirty and Perseus would cut off her head and he
would be victorious and
leave. Now imagine this from Medusa's perspective. As a
side-note, Medusa is pregnant. When Poseidon raped her, she
became pregnant. But a side effect of her new life was temporal
immortality, she has been stuck in stasis, unable to give birth.
 So Medusa is alone in exile with
no one but her two sisters. Suddenly she hears screaming, and
fighting, and she hears swords clatter and screaming.
 She would have been scared, and panicked, and
very, very afraid. People have tried to come kill her before, 
but she probably knew that her time was short. Now, as far
as I know, I don't think Greek women held much resentment towards
rape-babies. Like, yeah, she was horribly violated and
can do absolutely nothing about it, but Greek women
tended to be very steadfast in a "this child is mine and I 
<i>will</i> love them" mentality. Medusa is scared for herself
and for her child. She fights, but Perseus was gifted 
special weapons by the gods, made just for killing her.
Her gifts from Athena become virtually useless. For as hard as
she tries to fight, Perseus murders Medusa in cold blood, no matter
what his mentality was. And don't get me wrong, I love the 
story of Perseus. But it's still really sad that Medusa gets
treated so unjustly. Plus, Athena helped Perseus, too! She gave him
the mirror shield so that he would be able to by-pass
Medusa's stone glare!

So sometimes, I can't help but wonder if maybe Athena planned for someone to 
kill Medusa. Not in any malicious way, but just knowing that for
as much as she tried to help in any way she could, she knew it 
would probably be more merciful to just put Medusa out of her 
misery, after everything she's been through. It's a testament
to the hardships of Greek women. Whether they tried to help
each other or not, even a goddess couldn't save Medusa from
her horrible fate.
