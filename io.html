<p> The story of Io and Zeus made up the over-arcing tale of one
of the first Greek mythology books I ever owned. It was a very clever
way to introduce the basics of Greek myth while also telling the 
stories through another myth. It goes like this:<p/>
<p>Io was one of the many women Zeus fell in love with while he
did nothing sitting on top of Mount Olympus. Because he has
nothing better to do, Zeus whisked himself
down to the earth to have dubiously consensual sexual
relations with the fair maiden.

<p> Hera, the queen of the gods and Zeus' wife, was justifiably
suspicious, and
followed Zeus down to earth. In order to cover up his tracks,
Zeus transformed Io into a beautiful white heffer (a cow),
and claimed that he was not cheating on Hera.
To try to catch him in the act, Hera asked Zeus what he was doing.
Since he's a horrible person, Zeus claimed that he was preparing
the white cow (Io) as a gift for Hera, since cows are one of her
sacred animals. Convinced that he isn't telling her the truth,
but with no real proof, Hera sends her watchdog Argus, a man with
many, many eyes all around his body, to watch over the cow.
Since he has so many eyes, he can always have a few dozen pointed
Io's way as they take turns resting. As such, Io is trapped, and
she is convinced that she's going to die as a cow.
But fear not! Even Zeus knows when he's
gone too far. Zeus sends his son, the
messenger of the gods, Hermes, to trick Argus so that he
can save Io. Hermes does this by whipping
out his lute (which he invented at the tender age of like 10 days old),
and begins singing Argus to sleep. Eventually, it works. All of
Argus' eyes slowly close one by one until he is in a peaceful
slumber. For good measure, Hermes kills him. Hermes rescues Io, and by rescues Io, I mean Io runs
far, far away, as fast as her little cow legs will take her.
She runs all the way to Egypt.
There, she is found by some priestesses of Isis, among whose
sacred animals also included the cow, and Io was heralded as a
sign from the goddess Isis. Either Zeus finally gave up or his
charm just wore off, but after a few celebrations, Io did return
to her human form, and she lived out the rest of her days as a
high priestess of Isis. She never returned home, which is 100%
understandable. Once you've been
royally screwed over by the Greek gods, I'd start worshipping a 
whole new pantheon, too.
