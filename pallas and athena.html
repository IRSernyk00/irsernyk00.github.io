<center><h1>Pallas and Athena</h1></center>
<p>This is another myth that I've seen written very, very few times,
which makes it another of my very favorites. It's so fond to me
that I named my little kitten after the heroine.

<p>When the goddess Athena first burst forth from Zeus' skull
(a story for another day), she was young and eager and curious. 
Pallas was a nymph, and the daughter of Triton, son of Poseidon.
Triton raised the girls side by side, and taught them the art of war.
The two spent their days training and loving each other's
company. Athena was happy, and Zeus took it upon himself to ruin 
everything, as he
usually does, under the impression that Athena was just
spending too much of her time down on the earth, instead of
up on Olympus with the other gods.
 One day, whilst Athena and Pallas were sparring,
Zeus, the all-mighty douche, 
distracted Pallas with his fear-inspiring shield, the Aegis. 
Pallas was terrified of the horrible image in the clouds, and 
had become distracted. Athena hadn't noticed, and aimed a blow at
Pallas that she could have easily blocked, but she didn't.
Athena's spear pierced Pallas' heart, and she died in Athena's arms, under the 
impression that Athena's aim had been the thing that had slayed
her best friend. To honor her, Athena took on the name Pallas, 
immortalizing her friend in herself as Pallas Athena.
