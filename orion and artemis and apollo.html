<center><h1>The Tragedy of Orion</h1></center>
<p>This is one of the most obscure myths that I know. I've only
ever seen one or two published versions, but it is among one of my very
favorites.

<p> The goddess of the moon, Artemis, is also the goddess of
virginity and "no boys allowed". She detests the thought of
cooties and does everything in her divine power to avoid all boys
that aren't her twin brother, Apollo, or the other gods. Except, of
course, for Orion. Orion was the only man Artemis could stand, 
and he became one of her very best friends. He was a fantastic
hunter, a big plus for a goddess of the hunt. He knew better than
to make any sort of advance on her, a common sensenality that was
incredibly lackluster amongst his male companions. I believe 
Artemis was so fond of and confident in him that she even allowed 
him to bathe with her and her huntresses, which was a very, very big
deal. Orion and Artemis were practically inseperable, and
it made Artemis' brother Apollo very, very jealous. As I recall,
Apollo lured Orion away from Artemis. He lured him to the sea, and
whether he told him to see how far out he could swim, or to see
how many fish he could catch, I don't remember, but I do remember
that once Orion was out far enough into the water, Apollo took out
his bow and slayed Orion where he swam. Artemis came upon the
scene and was laid to immediate anguish. She mourned for the only
man to know her company, and was grieved at her brother's
betrayal. So, as was one of the most sacred forms of mercy enacted by the
gods, Artemis took Orion's body, and lifted him up to the stars,
where, as the goddess of the night, she'd be able to see him again
and again for eternity.
<p> I've always liked this one in particular. For that it just
feels very unspoken of and special to me, and for the fact that Orion
is always the first constellation that I can find in the night sky.
